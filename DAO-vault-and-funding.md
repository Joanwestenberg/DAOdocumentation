This section discusses how DAO members can manage the distribution of community funds and decide where they should be invested, what projects they should support, and how much should be spent; it also looks at how funding allocations are decided.

The first step of this process is to create a multi-sig wallet that holds community funds in a secure vault and contract. This contract can be whatever the community wants it to be, including an existing organization or business, but it will need to have some public parameters on which all members agree before they send their ether to it. This vault contract can be used to distribute funds to any legal proposal that includes a description of how they plan on spending the money.

The second step is for proposal submitters to send their proposal along with what percentage of the total amount of ether held in the vault they are requesting. The current percentage will be divided by this number and sent back,

The disbursement of funds from the vault is done through a proposal that requires a minimum amount of voter support in order to avoid being denied. The proposal can take two forms: a single payment, which would require one “yes” vote and no “no” votes to pass; or a series of payments that form part of a larger project. Proposals for partial funding are also required to have a minimum number of supporters for each stage in order to prevent any single stage from being stopped or delayed due to lack of support.

The way the contract manages each proposal depends on whether it’s a single payment or a series of payments. In the former case, it means passing a vote to transfer the funds from the vault contract to another account. In the latter case, it means allocating money for each subsequent proposal toward the next stage of the project until it’s finished.

Each member that creates a proposal has the option of adding an ether value per hour if the proposal requires team working resources, as well as a maximum number of hours for which they will work on it.
