**We envision a world where DAOs become more prevalent than existing legal frameworks.** 
We want to enable people to truly own themselves and share their skills, ideas, values, creations, and labor freely with the rest of humanity without asking permission from anyone else.
A few examples of how this might play out in our daily lives are:
- Holders of house deeds can create a DAO that allows them to collaboratively manage and maintain their homes instead of hiring a single contractor or management company
- A group of musicians distributed across the globe could create a DAO where they vote on which songs to record, share revenue from those recordings equitably, and compensate all band members according to their contributions
- A decentralized, federated social media platform can engage directly with its users and automatically reward those who create value for the network without exploiting their privacy or attention
We wonâ€™t be releasing a specific implementation of this framework, as we believe it should be configurable to suit the needs and values of the crypto community.
