While it’s possible to make proposals concerning anything related to managing the group’s shared resources, most proposals will probably be related to the allocation of community funds, the execution of technology roadmaps, and the direction of future development of software that interfaces with the DAO or enhances its capabilities.
To initiate a proposal, the creator must send the designated amount of ether to the DAO’s contract with a data element that uniquely and verifiably identifies them and their proposal. The DAO’s contract will hold this ether in escrow until the proposal period ends, at which point it will distribute it to the appropriate address or contract as determined by the results of the vote.

In order to prevent spam proposals, the initial transaction must also pay a nonzero ether fee that will be collected into the community vault.

In addition to being able to elect administrators, maintainers, and moderators, DAO members can set up an ad hoc, temporary arbitration system if needed. Arbitration is necessary when two or more members are at odds with one another but the rest of the community has not yet settled on a solution.

The first line item on any proposal should be a brief summary of its purpose and an estimate of the time needed to fulfill it, so community members know whether or not they want to support it. There can be multiple line items for a proposal that cover different aspects of the same topic.

The creator can set a voting period length of between 1 and 4 weeks to allow sufficient time for members to evaluate the proposal and vote before the end date is reached. This will enable proposals to continue evolving even if they don’t garner enough support initially, but there must be a reasonable time period allotted for new members to get up to speed on the proposal before it’s put up for another vote.

Additionally, if at least 51% of all stakeholders support a proposal within the first 30 days, then it will be eligible for an automatic development mechanism that allows proposals to create working groups to further their purposes and continue their work while the proposal is in progress. This non-contentious mechanism is in place to avoid creating a bureaucratic proposal process that would be too slow or complicated to operate.

All proposals are open for discussion on the forums until voting opens, at which point they can either become active or fail by default if there aren’t enough votes.

All users who send a valid transaction to the DAO’s contract during any given time frame are allowed one vote per DAO token they hold at this start time for each of the proposals.
The creator of a proposal is not entitled to a vote.
