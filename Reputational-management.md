This section looks at how reputation is calculated and used within the DAO to encourage high-quality proposals, discourage low-quality ones, and drive the creation of new projects that members may not have thought about themselves.

The DAO should incorporate a function that assigns each member points based on the number of votes they have cast. This can be programmed in any way that is agreed upon by community members, but it should take into account both the quantity and quality of their vote, with quantity having a more significant impact on reputation.

Achieving a specific reputation level should unlock certain privileges within the system, with higher levels offering more voting power. For instance, if the first tier is 0–999 reputation points, then voters could have 1 vote. If it’s 1000–4999, then they can have 2 votes. The next level might be 5k–19k, giving them 3 votes — and so on until the highest possible tier is reached at 40 million or more.

The first step is to create an accumulator contract that starts with 0 rep and tracks each proposal’s level of support, opposition, and overall “yes”/”no” value.

There are five tiers of reputation that a member can have, each with a different set of privileges. This includes things such as being able to create proposals without going through the vetting process, having their own private forum within the DAO, and being eligible for extra funding from the vault beyond what is given by other members.
