The multi-tiered voting structure provides a way for everyone from house members to content creators and consumers to self-organize around a shared set of values without subjecting themselves to the hierarchical control inherent in today’s corporations, nonprofits, and other institutions.
The DAO has created a different type of voting system that is unique in the cryptocurrency space. Under this model, each Ethereum account gets one vote per the proposal, where its weight is proportional to the number of ETH it contains at the time of the vote. Voting power is locked for three weeks following an unsuccessful proposal.

It’s required that a minimum number of members (or weighted voting power) be reached for the proposal to pass.

The first tier is the time slot during which all non-divisible votes cast by token holders are counted equally. Any member who doesn’t vote has the equivalent of their tokens divided evenly among those votes that were cast by other members.

The second tier is a sliding window used to calculate an estimate for the total value of support, opposition, and uncast or invalid votes. The time window slides forward by 7 days after each vote closes, so the minimum number of supporters required for a proposal to pass is constantly changing based on the current level of support, opposition, and overall token distribution.

The third tier is an exponential decay used to calculate how much weight each subsequent vote carries. This means that the amount of power required to win decreases over time, making it easier for a proposal to pass as more votes are cast.

The fourth tier is an accumulator used for non-divisible tokens in order to prevent loss of voting power when certain members abstain from voting.

The fifth tier is the quorum, which represents the minimum amount of support required for a proposal to pass. This number cannot be changed or manipulated by any vote and can only be increased over time as more tokens are minted into existence.
